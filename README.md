CryptoProtos Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin allows you to encrypt and decrypt entire Markdown files in your Obsidian vault using a password.
It uses AES-256-GCM encryption with a unique salt and IV for each operation.
The plugin prompts for a password every time — it is never stored.
Features

    🔐 Encrypt the current TXT file with a password

    🔓 Decrypt the current TXT file with a password

    ✏️ Fully integrates with the Obsidian editor

    🔄 Compatible with external tools (e.g., Python, JavaScript) if the encryption format is respected

    🚫 No password storage — total client-side security

Security Note:

The password is never stored or cached. If you forget it, the file content cannot be decrypted.
Always use strong, memorable passwords and store them securely.
